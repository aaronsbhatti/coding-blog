# Aaron's Coding Blog

_Welcome!_:tada:!

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Aaron, a software developer originally from London, UK. I have been a developer for over 10 years and have worked in many interesting fields such as online gaming, procurement, insurance, property and e-learning to name but a few.

My aim with this blog is to share what I am working on, what I'm learning and any tips, tricks and opinions about programming in general.
